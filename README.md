# FlyingParticleSimulator

# Description

The project involves the development of a simulator for flying particles. The aim of this simulator is to create a tool that enables the visualization and exploration of virtual particle movement in a two-dimensional space. Users will be able to experiment with various scenarios and observe the impact of parameter changes on particle motion. The offered functionalities are ideal for educational, demonstrative, or artistic purposes. The implemented particle collision algorithm represents ideal elastic collisions.
